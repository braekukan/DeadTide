# DeadTide

I am the project owner on this school project for a zombie game we are creating called Dead Tide. 
This game is currently became a MVP(Most Valuable Product) and has not been complete yet.

Within this repository is scripts that I used within the game that are coded in C#. 
The overall game was created and developed in Unity.
